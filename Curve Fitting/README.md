## 📖 Introduction
Curve fitting is a numerical technique used to find a mathematical relationship between
two or more variables based on observed data.  
The objective is to determine a curve that best represents the given data points by
minimizing the overall error.

The **Least Squares Method** is commonly used for curve fitting, as it minimizes the
sum of squares of the deviations between observed and computed values.
