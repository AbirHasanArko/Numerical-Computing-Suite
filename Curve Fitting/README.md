# Curve Fitting (Regression)

## Introduction
Curve fitting is a numerical method used to find a mathematical equation that best represents a given set of experimental or observed data points.
The goal is to minimize the error between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.

In this experiment, different curve fitting techniques using the **Least Squares Method** are implemented.

## Methods Included
1. Least Squares Line (Linear Regression)
2. Least Squares Polynomial (Quadratic)
3. Non-Linear Curve Fitting

## Applications
- Engineering data analysis
- Trend prediction
- Scientific experiments
- Economics and statistics

## Software Requirement
- C++ Compiler (GCC / Dev-C++)
