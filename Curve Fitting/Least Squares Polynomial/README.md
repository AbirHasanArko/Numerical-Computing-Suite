# Least Squares Polynomial

## Objective
To fit a second-degree polynomial of the form **y = a + bx + cx²** using the least squares method.

## Theory
Polynomial curve fitting is used when data does not follow a straight-line relationship.
A quadratic polynomial provides a better approximation by minimizing the squared error.

## Mathematical Model
y = a + bx + cx²

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of data points.
2. Calculate required summations.
3. Form normal equations.
4. Solve the equations using elimination method.
5. Display polynomial coefficients.

## Result
The quadratic polynomial that best fits the given data is obtained.
