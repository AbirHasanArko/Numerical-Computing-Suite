# Least Squares Line

## Objective
To determine the best fitting straight line of the form **y = a + bx** for a given set of data points using the Least Squares Method.

## Theory
The least squares method minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations between the observed data points and the estimated line.
The constants **a** and **b** are calculated using the normal equations derived from partial differentiation.

## Mathematical Model
y = a + bx

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of data points.
2. Read values of x and y.
3. Compute Σx, Σy, Σxy, Σx².
4. Calculate constants a and b.
5. Display the fitted equation.

## Result
The best fitting straight line equation is obtained using least squares approximation.
