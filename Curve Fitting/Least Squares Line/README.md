## 📖 Introduction
The Least Squares Line method is used to find the **best fitting straight line**
for a given set of experimental or observed data points.
The method minimizes the **sum of squares of vertical errors**
between the observed values and the computed values.

---

## 📌 Mathematical Model
The straight line equation is assumed as:

y = a + b·x

where a and b are constants to be determined.

---

## 📐 Normal Equations
Using the least squares principle, the normal equations are:

sum(y) = n·a + b·sum(x)

sum(xy) = a·sum(x) + b·sum(x²)

Solving these equations gives the values of a and b.

## 🧾 Algorithm
1. Read the number of data points n
2. Read values of x and y
3. Compute sum(x), sum(y), sum(xy), sum(x²)
4. Form the normal equations
5. Solve for a and b
6. Display the fitted line equation
