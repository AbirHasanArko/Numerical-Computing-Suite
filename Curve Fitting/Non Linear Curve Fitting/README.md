# Non-Linear Curve Fitting

## Objective
To fit a non-linear curve to a given data set using transformation techniques.

## Theory
Some relationships cannot be represented using linear equations.
Non-linear curve fitting transforms the given equation into linear form using logarithms.

Common models include:
- y = ae^(bx)
- y = ax^b

## Algorithm
1. Transform the non-linear equation into linear form.
2. Apply least squares method.
3. Compute constants.
4. Convert back to original form.

## Result
The non-linear curve that best fits the data is determined.
