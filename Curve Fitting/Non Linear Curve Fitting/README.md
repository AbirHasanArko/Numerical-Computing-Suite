## 📖 Introduction
Non-linear curve fitting is used when data cannot be accurately
represented by linear or polynomial models.
Such equations are transformed into linear form
before applying the least squares method.

---

## 📌 Common Models
Some widely used non-linear models are:

- **Exponential curve**
\[
y = ae^{bx}
\]

- **Power curve**
\[
y = ax^b
\]

---

## 🔄 Linearization Technique
For the exponential model:

\[
y = ae^{bx}
\]

Taking logarithm on both sides:

\[
\ln y = \ln a + bx
\]

This converts the equation into a linear form suitable for least squares fitting.
